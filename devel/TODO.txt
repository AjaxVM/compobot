Make sending messages add them to the logger - do this by calling priv_msg with the correct args...
Change names of methods of plugins over to Keeyai's version.
Restore or write doc-strings for everything.
Write special wrapper functions for interacting with the server - like "msg", etc. - to the bot, ie
	Make it so that when a plugin wants to send a message - it calls:
		"self.bot.send_message(msg)"
	This should allow us to make a queue - ie - so only one plugin may "respond" to a msg,
	that way we don't have numerous plugins saying stuff when you give them a command or something...

Add ability to register/login to nickname - so we cand send private msg's....
Make chatter respond ot private messages, privately ;)
Find out how to get the bot to have admin access on "ChanServ" protected servers.

Write a topic countdown plugin - for pyweek.
Write a simple "game" plugin - that allows you to play a game with a user,
	make sure to block "chatter" plugin from replying to messages!
	Game will be a simple "RockPaperScissors" game:
		request a game from next user in list:
			!if no play - add to ignore and go on
			!else - request R, P, or S
			randomly pick R, P, or S
			scan results:
				!if my pick == users pick - request a redo
				!elif my pick > user pick - say "I win!"
					add to ignore list.
				!else - request new game
	Also - if a user priv_msgs the bot with "Want to play a game?"
		 say random pick of ["Sure thing!", "Absolutely", "What are we waiting for?", "Yes :)"]
		 begin game-play function again - only skip the user part.
