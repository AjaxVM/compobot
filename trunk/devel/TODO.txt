Restore or write doc-strings for everything  ~~Plugins could still use some stuff - and the main bot itself.

Add ability to register/login to nickname - so we cand send private msg's....  ~~Sorta check - will register - but the
													you have the problem of letting the
													chatter know it can send pm's.
													Also - once you register a bot - 
													it is like registering a regular nick - 
													you need a unique name - and keep that
													same nick forever :(
													SO my conclusion is that this will probably
													be an unnecessary feature :/
Make chatter respond to private messages, privately ;)

Write a topic countdown plugin - for pyweek.
Write a simple "game" plugin - that allows you to play a game with a user,
	make sure to block "chatter" plugin from replying to messages!
	Game will be a simple "RockPaperScissors" game:
		request a game from next user in list:
			!if no play - add to ignore and go on
			!else - request R, P, or S
			randomly pick R, P, or S
			scan results:
				!if my pick == users pick - request a redo
				!elif my pick > user pick - say "I win!"
					add to ignore list.
				!else - request new game
	Also - if a user priv_msgs the bot with "Want to play a game?"
		 say random pick of ["Sure thing!", "Absolutely", "What are we waiting for?", "Yes :)"]
		 begin game-play function again - only skip the user part.
